Hey, I'm a Software Developer, formerly at working on Maps APIs at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). I'm also a web designer and I enjoy creating elegant, functional UIs.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
